- Compare dependency on Collin Head rules with (Berkeley + Stanford CFG)
   UAS
   - python script to read multiple line per sentence and generate one line per sentence phrase parsing file


- adding simple chinese language-specific features
- adding shape feature for english (These features seem really complicated, I think we should skip them.)

- run the berkeley error analysis script to claim our parser different error comparsing to other traditional parsers

- Try different binarization.
* - Try hashing negative features separately.
* - Negative feature hashing.

after the above:
	- Comparison with section 22. Fei Xia paper.
		- generate dev part file with gold dependency
	- Runtime., Select sentences based on length
		-
	- Train with only 5% of TreeBank. 100% dep, 5%. (maybe turn off
	   lexical features.)

	- Pruning in third section. Table -
	- Pruning fast pruning.
	- Pruning by dependency labels.
    - Run oracle experiments
    - Train delex model.

- Faster?
- ZPar shift-reduce...
- run zpar -- on training...
- run maltparser (model ready)
